# You will own nothing in the future (Software locks)

If I paid for the product, I should have full ownership and be allowed to do anything I want with the product. Companies should not dictate how I should be using it, this includes installation of custom software. It is almost impossible to use a modern smartphone today without a Google or Apple account.

Software locks is used to prevent repairs which is proven by Huge Jeffrey's videos, where he would assess the repairability of phones by performing a teardown of 2 identical phone and swapping the authentic parts. More often than not, the software detects that the hardware is tampered with and refuses to work. This serialization of parts (parts married to the PCB board, preventing replacements) is a common practice and threatens independent repairs. Apparently, you can't even replace a sleep sensor on Apple's mac book now.

DRM - imagine that you now need to jailbreak a car you own to keep your ass warm
Tesla car locks also lock down features with software. Yes that feature is available in the car, the hardware is capable of performing that task but it's block by the software unless you pay a certain amount of money to unlock that feature. Would you feel like you fully own that car after paying a huge sum of money?

## Planned obsolescence

Companies plan when their product get's obsolete, by deliberating slowing down phones, which have been caught in apple products.

## E-waste

unauthorized repair shops cant be authorized.
farm equipment have to be thrown away, company who makes it is violating the rule but because no one is enforcing etc, they get to do all these.

Once upon a time, any electronics device you bought would come with a schematic, documenting it's inner workings. Now, just try to replace a battery on your laptop and you would be faced with a bunch of roadblocks; proprietary software, adhesives,  Nowadays, it's pretty involved just to replace a battery from say, a laptop.

nowadays, product is locked down with adhesive. Apple, one of the biggest anti repair company invented a mechanically inferior screw called the pentalope screw just to keep people out of the hardware.

Products are no longer repairable anymore.
