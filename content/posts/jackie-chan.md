In this post, I will attempt to gaslight you into thinking that I am perfectly normal. You will learn various reasons why Jackie is superior and an ideal role model, and perhaps start bowing down too. These reasons do not include the bogus "he does all his own stunts" [nonsense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oycSHmJZGyE). Shame on him for claiming that, though, and on everyone who enables that manufactured perception, but that's a story for another day.

# He is a polymath

He does it all: directing, acting, scriptwriting, editing, choreography, stunts, and more. Even outside of filmmaking, he is a musician. He creates and sings his own songs too, which are usually heard in the closing credits of his films.

Remember, these accomplishments did not happen in the age of information. [Take a glimpse](https://youtu.be/erZSLrLm2i8?si=bopDr7SDis8piiDW) at how hard editing was back then. What other excuse do we have to not absolutely learn and do everything by ourselves in 2024? A level of resourcefulness we should all strive for.

# He is more than Rush Hour 2

When asked about your favorite Jackie Chan movie, there's a good chance you would name something from Jackie's Hollywood era, and there's nothing wrong; the quality of his action sequences is something I can only dream of pulling off.

However, I would argue that his value lies in the golden age of Hong Kong action cinema. His movies produced during that era, along with [The Three Dragons](https://www.easternfilmfans.co.uk/the-three-dragons-trilogy-an-overview-by-jamie-macdonald-and-paul-findlay/), define HK Action cinema. In terms of action, they are ahead of their time and unmatched even today.

# He is a Genre

Not only did he pioneer the genre of action comedy (unpopular opinion: his best fight scenes are ones where he doesn't try to be funny), but his filmography contains so many titles that he is essentially a genre; such a level of life dedication is inspiring.
