In this post, I will attempt to convince you that I am a perfectly normal human being capable of functioning in society. You will learn various reasons why Jackie Chan is superior and an ideal role model, and perhaps start bowing down too. These reasons do not include the bogus "he does all his own stunts" [nonsense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oycSHmJZGyE).

# He is a polymath

He does it all: directing, acting, scriptwriting, editing, choreography, stunts, etc. Even outside of filmmaking, he is a musician. He creates and sings his own songs too, which are usually heard in the closing credits of his films. Remember, he does all these things while not being in the age of information. [Take a glimpse](https://youtu.be/erZSLrLm2i8?si=bopDr7SDis8piiDW) at how hard editing was in the 1980s. What other excuse do we have to not absolutely learn and do everything by ourselves in 2024? A level of resourcefulness we should all strive for.

# He is more than Rush Hour 2

When asked about your favorite Jackie Chan movie, there's a good chance you would name something from Jackie's Hollywood era, and there's nothing wrong; the quality of his action sequences is something I can only dream of pulling off. However, I would argue that his value lies in the golden age of Hong Kong action cinema. His movies produced during that era, along with [The Three Dragons](https://www.easternfilmfans.co.uk/the-three-dragons-trilogy-an-overview-by-jamie-macdonald-and-paul-findlay/), define HK Action cinema. In terms of action, they are ahead of their time and unmatched even today.

# He is a Genre

Not only did he pioneer the genre of action comedy (unpopular opinion: his best fight scenes are ones where he doesn't try to be funny), but his filmography contains so many titles that he is essentially a genre; such a level of life dedication is inspiring.
