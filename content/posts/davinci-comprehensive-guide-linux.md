## Installation

Go to resolve's official site to download and run their installer. If double clicking on icon does not run the app, run the app in the terminal with `/opt/resolve/bin/resolve` and debug from there.

### Debugging

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y87MFmcy3lc) shows the installation process for Ubuntu 24.04. It includes a comprehensive guide on hunting down and resolving dependencies issues which is useful and applicable to any linux executable.

### Alternate Installation Method

I have not personally tried these methods.

- Docker/Podman: https://github.com/fat-tire/resolve
- Distrobox: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmRiZQ9IZfc

## H264/H265/AAC Codec Workaround

### FFMPEG Conversion

```
for file in *.mp4 ; do ffmpeg -i ${file} -crf 16 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac outfolder/`basename ${file} .mp4`-16.mp4 ; done
```

### Transcode specific footage on the fly while editing.

This is a Studio specific problem, as the studio version still does not support AAC codec.

This script I wrote that converts footage on the fly with a hotkey: https://github.com/jchai01/davinci-resolve-aac-workaround-macro

### Magic Byte Codes

This is one way to workaround several Linux-specific annoyances. Consider supporting them and paying for their product especially if you are making money from it.

Download link to the davinci-resolve-studio installer can be found here: https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/support/family/davinci-resolve-and-fusion

On an arch system, you can use `yay -S davinci-resolve-studio`.

## I can't move or maximize my Davinci Resolve window around

- Hold down the `super` key and drag the window around with your mouse.
- `alt+F10` is usually the hotkey to maximize the window of any software.
