It is referenced from [Hugo's deployment docs on Github Pages.](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)

However, their example script builds and deploy to another URL. I have already setup a repo for Github Pages and all I need to do is copy the files generated by Hugo to another existing repo and commit them.

```yaml

# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Hugo site to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages
on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:
# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: pages
  cancel-in-progress: false
# Default to bash
defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash
jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        run: |-
          git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
          git config --global user.name "username"
          git config --global credential.helper cache
          git clone https://${{secrets.API_TOKEN_GITHUB}}@github.com/<github_account>/<repo-to-clone>
          cp -r ${{ github.workspace }}/public/* ${{ github.workspace }}/clonedRepo -f
          cd clonedRepo
          git add .
          git commit -m "."
          git push
```

### Notes

- `${{ github.workspace }}` points to the checkout directory.

- `API_TOKEN_GITHUB` is generated in https://github.com/settings/tokens, then [added to the secrets folder in the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).
