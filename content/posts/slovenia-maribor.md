Welcome to my first travel blog! The friends I travel with are the type to post like 1 pathetic photo after traveling in Turkey for a week:

Exploiting the fact that it's 2024, I figured it would be a good time for me to step up and identify as an influencer. How else is anyone going to know about that explosive bowel movement after consuming Korean spicy noodles?

Anyway, courtesy of my friend hosting me, I got to visit Slovenia which, according to my friend, isn't touristy and one of the least diverse places in the world. I am convinced that I am the only Asian throughout my visit in Slovenia and the entire Hills of Rock concert (Bulgaria).

To return his kind gesture, I gave him a mug which has a photo of his favorite Indian that he misses dearly everyday: Yash Gupta. He got really excited.

We visited the city, which was indeed pretty empty and void of any tourists. Saw the uni, some oldest vine thing and some structures but all I remembered was trying one of the tastiest snack ever: Fruitebella!

We proceeded to climb hill Pohorje and chose the steepest route. Despite what I tried to make you believe in the video, we did not, in fact, conquer Pohorje â€” not even close. Conquering it would take >8 hours. On the way up, we climbed on top of some cool-looking structure and got some nice photos!

We stopped at the 1st checkpoint, which was approx < 1/3 of the hill. There, we threw some handstands and flips with whatever little energy was left.

After climbing...

- Swam in the ASIC miner powered heated swimming pool (crazy cool stuff).
- Greeted his parents/aunt with some not-so-nice Slovenian words that my friend taught me. Of course they laughed it off (still surprised at how chill and friendly they all are).
- Got a nice haircut from his super talented hairdresser aunt.
- A poker session in which his mum absolutely dominates everyone, even though it's the first time she played poker.
