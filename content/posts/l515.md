Important: Make sure you are are using a USB 3 port.

## RealSense-Viewer (Optional)

Run this to verify that the camera works.

**2.54.2** SDK version is needed in order to use L515 with it. Newer version dropped support for L515:
https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/13194

Correct version for L515:
https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases/tag/v2.54.2

Build guide:
https://dev.intelrealsense.com/docs/compiling-librealsense-for-linux-ubuntu-guide

## RTAB-Map

ROS2 not needed, just compile/download standalone rtabmap:
https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap/releases

For Linux, compiling from source is needed for RealSense support:
https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap/issues/694

Difficult to reconstruct environment, slight movement causes the feature not to match.
can't open the .ply pointcloud file in Blender, open it in MeshLab
Un-textured mesh, looks bad.
Scale seems accurate

## Open3D

Correct version is important, use this version:
`pip install pyrealsense2 v 2.54.2.5684`

Resolved one of the error with:

```python
pip uninstall opencv-python-headless -y
pip install opencv-python --upgrade
```

Capture dataset:
https://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/reconstruction_system/capture_your_own_dataset.html

No textured mesh:
https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/discussions/4947

Tried to generate textured mesh by running `color_map_optimization_for_reconstruction_system.py` as shown in this example:
https://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/sensor/realsense.html
but failed (likely due to VRAM limitation)

Error in the documentation, use this instead (note the --config):
`python3 run_system.py --config config/realsense.json --make`

- Huge file size when recording.
- Not to scale (~98 cm instead of 32cm when measuring the width of the laptop)
- No texture, running texture generation code failed.

## Troubleshoot

Realsense-viewer not working all of a sudden, stuck at loading screen:
plug into a USB2 slot and run the viewer, then plug it back to a USB3 slot

## Conclusion

- Absolutely unusable for 3D reconstruction purpose (Dot3D untested though).
- SLAM-based software have a hard time registering features.
