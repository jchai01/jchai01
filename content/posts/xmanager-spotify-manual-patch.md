Copied from xManager discord server:

### 1. Download and install:

- Latest ReVanced Manager through [revanced.app/download](https://revanced.app/download)
- AntiSplit-M tool from [their GitHub](https://github.com/AbdurazaaqMohammed/AntiSplit-M/releases/latest)
- Spotify app from [Play Store(recommended)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music) or other sources
  > NOTE: If you have a modded or other version of Spotify installed, youâ€™ll need to uninstall that first

### 2. Merge Spotify app with AntiSplit-M:

-# (Ignore this step if you already have a valid `.apk` file of stock Spotify app)

- Open AntiSplit-M app and click `Select from installed apps` then choose Spotify
- When prompted, choose where to save the merged `.apk`
- Wait until the app has been successfully merged and saved
- Uninstall previously installed Spotify app

### 3. Inside ReVanced Manager:

-# (give all necessary permissions when prompted to do so)

- Go to Patcher tab on the bottom navigation bar
- Tap on `Select an app` option
- Select `Storage` button at the bottom-right of the screen
- Navigate to the merged `Spotify.apk` file you just saved and select the file
- Ensure that all required patches like `Spoof Signature`, `Unlock premium` are selected
- Select the `Patch` button and wait for the process to complete.
- Once patching is done, click on `Install` button

# Notes

In step 2, "Uninstall previously installed Spotify app" is not needed as the patcher app will uninstall for you.
