Hello, I am a computer science student currently pursuing further studies. Here, I document my journey in tech to serve as a reference/guide for myself, such as issues I have resolved before, and hopefully, it can help someone else too. I write about things I am interested in from time to time. I have a wide variety of interests, so it's pretty hard to guess what I will write about next:)
