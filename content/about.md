Hello, I am a computer science student currently pursueing further studies. Here, I document my journey in tech to serve as a reference/guide for myself, such as issues I have resolved before and hopefully, it can help someone too. I write about things I am interested in from time to time too. I have a wide variety of interests so it's pretty hard to guess what I will write about next:)
